    "Summary": "This PowerShell Runbook (compatible with PowerShell Core) connects to Azure using an Automation Run As account and switches the specified Azure Function from a consumption app service plan to a premium app service plan or vice versa. You can attach a recurring schedule to this runbook to run it at a specific times. So the most cost effective solution can be set for short bursts of (planned) high demanding (but cost aware) function execution loads.",
